## Session Notes

### Session 1 - Project Kickoff
**Date:** 2024-12-21

**Accomplished:**
- Discussed project vision and scope
- Created proof-of-concept 3D visualization
- Established context engineering workflow
- Created initial documentation (CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, TASK.md, DECISIONS.md)
- Created INITIAL spec for project foundation

**Decisions Made:**
- Project name: **Pulsar**
- Using Vite + React + Three.js stack
- Context engineering with Claude.ai (planning) + Claude Code (implementation)
- Starting with MVP feature set, sci-fi aesthetic is priority
- INITIAL files: `initial-##-name.md`, PRPs: `prp-##-name.md`

**Next Session:**
- Generate PRP for project foundation: `/generate-prp INITIAL/initial-01-project-foundation.md`
- Execute foundation setup in Claude Code
- Get basic 3D scene rendering
